Overview
========

A curses-based Python 2/3 menuconfig implementation. The interface should feel
familiar to people used to mconf ('make menuconfig').

Supports the same keys as mconf, and also supports a set of keybindings
inspired by Vi:

  J/K     : Down/Up
  L       : Enter menu/Toggle item
  H       : Leave menu
  Ctrl-D/U: Page Down/Page Up
  G/End   : Jump to end of list
  g/Home  : Jump to beginning of list

[Space] toggles values if possible, and enters menus otherwise. [Enter] works
the other way around.

The mconf feature where pressing a key jumps to a menu entry with that
character in it in the current menu isn't supported. A jump-to feature for
jumping directly to any symbol (including invisible symbols), choice, menu or
comment (as in a Kconfig 'comment "Foo"') is available instead.

A few different modes are available:

  F: Toggle show-help mode, which shows the help text of the currently selected
  item in the window at the bottom of the menu display. This is handy when
  browsing through options.

  C: Toggle show-name mode, which shows the symbol name before each symbol menu
  entry

  A: Toggle show-all mode, which shows all items, including currently invisible
  items and items that lack a prompt. Invisible items are drawn in a different
  style to make them stand out.


Running
=======

menuconfig.py can be run either as a standalone executable or by calling the
menuconfig() function with an existing Kconfig instance. The second option is a
bit inflexible in that it will still load and save .config, etc.

When run in standalone mode, the top-level Kconfig file to load can be passed
as a command-line argument. With no argument, it defaults to "Kconfig".

The KCONFIG_CONFIG environment variable specifies the .config file to load (if
it exists) and save. If KCONFIG_CONFIG is unset, ".config" is used.

When overwriting a configuration file, the old version is saved to
<filename>.old (e.g. .config.old).

$srctree is supported through Kconfiglib.


Color schemes
=============

It is possible to customize the color scheme by setting the MENUCONFIG_STYLE
environment variable. For example, setting it to 'aquatic' will enable an
alternative, less yellow, more 'make menuconfig'-like color scheme, contributed
by Mitja Horvat (pinkfluid).

This is the current list of built-in styles:
    - default       classic Kconfiglib theme with a yellow accent
    - monochrome    colorless theme (uses only bold and standout) attributes,
                    this style is used if the terminal doesn't support colors
    - aquatic       blue-tinted style loosely resembling the lxdialog theme

It is possible to customize the current style by changing colors of UI
elements on the screen. This is the list of elements that can be stylized:

    - path          Top row in the main display, with the menu path
    - separator     Separator lines between windows. Also used for the top line
                    in the symbol information display.
    - list          List of items, e.g. the main display
    - selection     Style for the selected item
    - inv-list      Like list, but for invisible items. Used in show-all mode.
    - inv-selection Like selection, but for invisible items. Used in show-all
                    mode.
    - help          Help text windows at the bottom of various fullscreen
                    dialogs
    - show-help     Window showing the help text in show-help mode
    - frame         Frame around dialog boxes
    - body          Body of dialog boxes
    - edit          Edit box in pop-up dialogs
    - jump-edit     Edit box in jump-to dialog
    - text          Symbol information text

The color definition is a comma separated list of attributes:

    - fg:COLOR      Set the foreground/background colors. COLOR can be one of
      * or *        the basic 16 colors (black, red, green, yellow, blue,
    - bg:COLOR      magenta, cyan, white and brighter versions, for example,
                    brightred). On terminals that support more than 8 colors,
                    you can also directly put in a color number, e.g. fg:123
                    (hexadecimal and octal constants are accepted as well).
                    Colors outside the range -1..curses.COLORS-1 (which is
                    terminal-dependent) are ignored (with a warning). The COLOR
                    can be also specified using a RGB value in the HTML
                    notation, for example #RRGGBB. If the terminal supports
                    color changing, the color is rendered accurately.
                    Otherwise, the visually nearest color is used.

                    If the background or foreground color of an element is not
                    specified, it defaults to -1, representing the default
                    terminal foreground or background color.

                    Note: On some terminals a bright version of the color
                    implies bold.
    - bold          Use bold text
    - underline     Use underline text
    - standout      Standout text attribute (reverse color)

More often than not, some UI elements share the same color definition. In such
cases the right value may specify an UI element from which the color definition
will be copied. For example, "separator=help" will apply the current color
definition for "help" to "separator".

A keyword without the '=' is assumed to be a style template. The template name
is looked up in the built-in styles list and the style definition is expanded
in-place. With this, built-in styles can be used as basis for new styles.

For example, take the aquatic theme and give it a red selection bar:

MENUCONFIG_STYLE="aquatic selection=fg:white,bg:red"

If there's an error in the style definition or if a missing style is assigned
to, the assignment will be ignored, along with a warning being printed on
stderr.

The 'default' theme is always implicitly parsed first, so the following two
settings have the same effect:

    MENUCONFIG_STYLE="selection=fg:white,bg:red"
    MENUCONFIG_STYLE="default selection=fg:white,bg:red"

If the terminal doesn't support colors, the 'monochrome' theme is used, and
MENUCONFIG_STYLE is ignored. The assumption is that the environment is broken
somehow, and that the important thing is to get something usable.


Other features
==============

  - Seamless terminal resizing

  - No dependencies on *nix, as the 'curses' module is in the Python standard
    library

  - Unicode text entry

  - Improved information screen compared to mconf:

      * Expressions are split up by their top-level &&/|| operands to improve
        readability

      * Undefined symbols in expressions are pointed out

      * Menus and comments have information displays

      * Kconfig definitions are printed

      * The include path is shown, listing the locations of the 'source'
        statements that included the Kconfig file of the symbol (or other
        item)


Limitations
===========

Doesn't work out of the box on Windows, but can be made to work with

    pip install windows-curses

Overview
========

Kconfiglib is a Python 2/3 library for scripting and extracting information
from Kconfig (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt)
configuration systems.

See the homepage at https://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib for a longer
overview.

Since Kconfiglib 12.0.0, the library version is available in
kconfiglib.VERSION, which is a (<major>, <minor>, <patch>) tuple, e.g.
(12, 0, 0).


Using Kconfiglib on the Linux kernel with the Makefile targets
==============================================================

For the Linux kernel, a handy interface is provided by the
scripts/kconfig/Makefile patch, which can be applied with either 'git am' or
the 'patch' utility:

  $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/master/makefile.patch | git am
  $ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib/master/makefile.patch | patch -p1

Warning: Not passing -p1 to patch will cause the wrong file to be patched.

Please tell me if the patch does not apply. It should be trivial to apply
manually, as it's just a block of text that needs to be inserted near the other
*conf: targets in scripts/kconfig/Makefile.

Look further down for a motivation for the Makefile patch and for instructions
on how you can use Kconfiglib without it.

If you do not wish to install Kconfiglib via pip, the Makefile patch is set up
so that you can also just clone Kconfiglib into the kernel root:

  $ git clone git://github.com/ulfalizer/Kconfiglib.git
  $ git am Kconfiglib/makefile.patch  (or 'patch -p1 < Kconfiglib/makefile.patch')

Warning: The directory name Kconfiglib/ is significant in this case, because
it's added to PYTHONPATH by the new targets in makefile.patch.

The targets added by the Makefile patch are described in the following
sections.


make kmenuconfig
----------------

This target runs the curses menuconfig interface with Python 3. As of
Kconfiglib 12.2.0, both Python 2 and Python 3 are supported (previously, only
Python 3 was supported, so this was a backport).


make guiconfig
--------------

This target runs the Tkinter menuconfig interface. Both Python 2 and Python 3
are supported. To change the Python interpreter used, pass
PYTHONCMD=<executable> to 'make'. The default is 'python'.


make [ARCH=<arch>] iscriptconfig
--------------------------------

This target gives an interactive Python prompt where a Kconfig instance has
been preloaded and is available in 'kconf'. To change the Python interpreter
used, pass PYTHONCMD=<executable> to 'make'. The default is 'python'.

To get a feel for the API, try evaluating and printing the symbols in
kconf.defined_syms, and explore the MenuNode menu tree starting at
kconf.top_node by following 'next' and 'list' pointers.

The item contained in a menu node is found in MenuNode.item (note that this can
be one of the constants kconfiglib.MENU and kconfiglib.COMMENT), and all
symbols and choices have a 'nodes' attribute containing their menu nodes
(usually only one). Printing a menu node will print its item, in Kconfig
format.

If you want to look up a symbol by name, use the kconf.syms dictionary.


make scriptconfig SCRIPT=<script> [SCRIPT_ARG=<arg>]
----------------------------------------------------

This target runs the Python script given by the SCRIPT parameter on the
configuration. sys.argv[1] holds the name of the top-level Kconfig file
(currently always "Kconfig" in practice), and sys.argv[2] holds the SCRIPT_ARG
argument, if given.

See the examples/ subdirectory for example scripts.


make dumpvarsconfig
-------------------

This target prints a list of all environment variables referenced from the
Kconfig files, together with their values. See the
Kconfiglib/examples/dumpvars.py script.

Only environment variables that are referenced via the Kconfig preprocessor
$(FOO) syntax are included. The preprocessor was added in Linux 4.18.


Using Kconfiglib without the Makefile targets
=============================================

The make targets are only needed to pick up environment variables exported from
the Kbuild makefiles and referenced inside Kconfig files, via e.g.
'source "arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig" and commands run via '$(shell,...)'.

These variables are referenced as of writing (Linux 4.18), together with sample
values:

  srctree          (.)
  ARCH             (x86)
  SRCARCH          (x86)
  KERNELVERSION    (4.18.0)
  CC               (gcc)
  HOSTCC           (gcc)
  HOSTCXX          (g++)
  CC_VERSION_TEXT  (gcc (Ubuntu 7.3.0-16ubuntu3) 7.3.0)

Older kernels only reference ARCH, SRCARCH, and KERNELVERSION.

If your kernel is recent enough (4.18+), you can get a list of referenced
environment variables via 'make dumpvarsconfig' (see above). Note that this
command is added by the Makefile patch.

To run Kconfiglib without the Makefile patch, set the environment variables
manually:

  $ srctree=. ARCH=x86 SRCARCH=x86 KERNELVERSION=`make kernelversion` ... python(3)
  >>> import kconfiglib
  >>> kconf = kconfiglib.Kconfig()  # filename defaults to "Kconfig"

Search the top-level Makefile for "Additional ARCH settings" to see other
possibilities for ARCH and SRCARCH.


Intro to symbol values
======================

Kconfiglib has the same assignment semantics as the C implementation.

Any symbol can be assigned a value by the user (via Kconfig.load_config() or
Symbol.set_value()), but this user value is only respected if the symbol is
visible, which corresponds to it (currently) being visible in the menuconfig
interface.

For symbols with prompts, the visibility of the symbol is determined by the
condition on the prompt. Symbols without prompts are never visible, so setting
a user value on them is pointless. A warning will be printed by default if
Symbol.set_value() is called on a promptless symbol. Assignments to promptless
symbols are normal within a .config file, so no similar warning will be printed
by load_config().

Dependencies from parents and 'if'/'depends on' are propagated to properties,
including prompts, so these two configurations are logically equivalent:

(1)

  menu "menu"
      depends on A

  if B

  config FOO
      tristate "foo" if D
      default y
      depends on C

  endif

  endmenu

(2)

  menu "menu"
      depends on A

  config FOO
      tristate "foo" if A && B && C && D
      default y if A && B && C

  endmenu

In this example, A && B && C && D (the prompt condition) needs to be non-n for
FOO to be visible (assignable). If its value is m, the symbol can only be
assigned the value m: The visibility sets an upper bound on the value that can
be assigned by the user, and any higher user value will be truncated down.

'default' properties are independent of the visibility, though a 'default' will
often get the same condition as the prompt due to dependency propagation.
'default' properties are used if the symbol is not visible or has no user
value.

Symbols with no user value (or that have a user value but are not visible) and
no (active) 'default' default to n for bool/tristate symbols, and to the empty
string for other symbol types.

'select' works similarly to symbol visibility, but sets a lower bound on the
value of the symbol. The lower bound is determined by the value of the
select*ing* symbol. 'select' does not respect visibility, so non-visible
symbols can be forced to a particular (minimum) value by a select as well.

For non-bool/tristate symbols, it only matters whether the visibility is n or
non-n: m visibility acts the same as y visibility.

Conditions on 'default' and 'select' work in mostly intuitive ways. If the
condition is n, the 'default' or 'select' is disabled. If it is m, the
'default' or 'select' value (the value of the selecting symbol) is truncated
down to m.

When writing a configuration with Kconfig.write_config(), only symbols that are
visible, have an (active) default, or are selected will get written out (note
that this includes all symbols that would accept user values). Kconfiglib
matches the .config format produced by the C implementations down to the
character. This eases testing.

For a visible bool/tristate symbol FOO with value n, this line is written to
.config:

    # CONFIG_FOO is not set

The point is to remember the user n selection (which might differ from the
default value the symbol would get), while at the same sticking to the rule
that undefined corresponds to n (.config uses Makefile format, making the line
above a comment). When the .config file is read back in, this line will be
treated the same as the following assignment:

    CONFIG_FOO=n

In Kconfiglib, the set of (currently) assignable values for a bool/tristate
symbol appear in Symbol.assignable. For other symbol types, just check if
sym.visibility is non-0 (non-n) to see whether the user value will have an
effect.


Intro to the menu tree
======================

The menu structure, as seen in e.g. menuconfig, is represented by a tree of
MenuNode objects. The top node of the configuration corresponds to an implicit
top-level menu, the title of which is shown at the top in the standard
menuconfig interface. (The title is also available in Kconfig.mainmenu_text in
Kconfiglib.)

The top node is found in Kconfig.top_node. From there, you can visit child menu
nodes by following the 'list' pointer, and any following menu nodes by
following the 'next' pointer. Usually, a non-None 'list' pointer indicates a
menu or Choice, but menu nodes for symbols can sometimes have a non-None 'list'
pointer too due to submenus created implicitly from dependencies.

MenuNode.item is either a Symbol or a Choice object, or one of the constants
MENU and COMMENT. The prompt of the menu node can be found in MenuNode.prompt,
which also holds the title for menus and comments. For Symbol and Choice,
MenuNode.help holds the help text (if any, otherwise None).

Most symbols will only have a single menu node. A symbol defined in multiple
locations will have one menu node for each location. The list of menu nodes for
a Symbol or Choice can be found in the Symbol/Choice.nodes attribute.

Note that prompts and help texts for symbols and choices are stored in their
menu node(s) rather than in the Symbol or Choice objects themselves. This makes
it possible to define a symbol in multiple locations with a different prompt or
help text in each location. To get the help text or prompt for a symbol with a
single menu node, do sym.nodes[0].help and sym.nodes[0].prompt, respectively.
The prompt is a (text, condition) tuple, where condition determines the
visibility (see 'Intro to expressions' below).

This organization mirrors the C implementation. MenuNode is called
'struct menu' there, but I thought "menu" was a confusing name.

It is possible to give a Choice a name and define it in multiple locations,
hence why Choice.nodes is also a list.

As a convenience, the properties added at a particular definition location are
available on the MenuNode itself, in e.g. MenuNode.defaults. This is helpful
when generating documentation, so that symbols/choices defined in multiple
locations can be shown with the correct properties at each location.


Intro to expressions
====================

Expressions can be evaluated with the expr_value() function and printed with
the expr_str() function (these are used internally as well). Evaluating an
expression always yields a tristate value, where n, m, and y are represented as
0, 1, and 2, respectively.

The following table should help you figure out how expressions are represented.
A, B, C, ... are symbols (Symbol instances), NOT is the kconfiglib.NOT
constant, etc.

Expression            Representation
----------            --------------
A                     A
"A"                   A (constant symbol)
!A                    (NOT, A)
A && B                (AND, A, B)
A && B && C           (AND, A, (AND, B, C))
A || B                (OR, A, B)
A || (B && C && D)    (OR, A, (AND, B, (AND, C, D)))
A = B                 (EQUAL, A, B)
A != "foo"            (UNEQUAL, A, foo (constant symbol))
A && B = C && D       (AND, A, (AND, (EQUAL, B, C), D))
n                     Kconfig.n (constant symbol)
m                     Kconfig.m (constant symbol)
y                     Kconfig.y (constant symbol)
"y"                   Kconfig.y (constant symbol)

Strings like "foo" in 'default "foo"' or 'depends on SYM = "foo"' are
represented as constant symbols, so the only values that appear in expressions
are symbols***. This mirrors the C implementation.

***For choice symbols, the parent Choice will appear in expressions as well,
but it's usually invisible as the value interfaces of Symbol and Choice are
identical. This mirrors the C implementation and makes different choice modes
"just work".

Manual evaluation examples:

  - The value of A && B is min(A.tri_value, B.tri_value)

  - The value of A || B is max(A.tri_value, B.tri_value)

  - The value of !A is 2 - A.tri_value

  - The value of A = B is 2 (y) if A.str_value == B.str_value, and 0 (n)
    otherwise. Note that str_value is used here instead of tri_value.

    For constant (as well as undefined) symbols, str_value matches the name of
    the symbol. This mirrors the C implementation and explains why
    'depends on SYM = "foo"' above works as expected.

n/m/y are automatically converted to the corresponding constant symbols
"n"/"m"/"y" (Kconfig.n/m/y) during parsing.

Kconfig.const_syms is a dictionary like Kconfig.syms but for constant symbols.

If a condition is missing (e.g., <cond> when the 'if <cond>' is removed from
'default A if <cond>'), it is actually Kconfig.y. The standard __str__()
functions just avoid printing 'if y' conditions to give cleaner output.


Kconfig extensions
==================

Kconfiglib includes a couple of Kconfig extensions:

'source' with relative path
---------------------------

The 'rsource' statement sources Kconfig files with a path relative to directory
of the Kconfig file containing the 'rsource' statement, instead of relative to
the project root.

Consider following directory tree:

  Project
  +--Kconfig
  |
  +--src
     +--Kconfig
     |
     +--SubSystem1
        +--Kconfig
        |
        +--ModuleA
           +--Kconfig

In this example, assume that src/SubSystem1/Kconfig wants to source
src/SubSystem1/ModuleA/Kconfig.

With 'source', this statement would be used:

  source "src/SubSystem1/ModuleA/Kconfig"

With 'rsource', this turns into

  rsource "ModuleA/Kconfig"

If an absolute path is given to 'rsource', it acts the same as 'source'.

'rsource' can be used to create "position-independent" Kconfig trees that can
be moved around freely.


Globbing 'source'
-----------------

'source' and 'rsource' accept glob patterns, sourcing all matching Kconfig
files. They require at least one matching file, raising a KconfigError
otherwise.

For example, the following statement might source sub1/foofoofoo and
sub2/foobarfoo:

  source "sub[12]/foo*foo"

The glob patterns accepted are the same as for the standard glob.glob()
function.

Two additional statements are provided for cases where it's acceptable for a
pattern to match no files: 'osource' and 'orsource' (the o is for "optional").

For example, the following statements will be no-ops if neither "foo" nor any
files matching "bar*" exist:

  osource "foo"
  osource "bar*"

'orsource' does a relative optional source.

'source' and 'osource' are analogous to 'include' and '-include' in Make.


Generalized def_* keywords
--------------------------

def_int, def_hex, and def_string are available in addition to def_bool and
def_tristate, allowing int, hex, and string symbols to be given a type and a
default at the same time.


Extra optional warnings
-----------------------

Some optional warnings can be controlled via environment variables:

  - KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF: If set to 'y', warnings will be generated for all
    references to undefined symbols within Kconfig files. The only gotcha is
    that all hex literals must be prefixed with "0x" or "0X", to make it
    possible to distinguish them from symbol references.

    Some projects (e.g. the Linux kernel) use multiple Kconfig trees with many
    shared Kconfig files, leading to some safe undefined symbol references.
    KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF is useful in projects that only have a single Kconfig
    tree though.

    KCONFIG_STRICT is an older alias for this environment variable, supported
    for backwards compatibility.

  - KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF_ASSIGN: If set to 'y', warnings will be generated for
    all assignments to undefined symbols within .config files. By default, no
    such warnings are generated.

    This warning can also be enabled/disabled via the Kconfig.warn_assign_undef
    variable.


Preprocessor user functions defined in Python
---------------------------------------------

Preprocessor functions can be defined in Python, which makes it simple to
integrate information from existing Python tools into Kconfig (e.g. to have
Kconfig symbols depend on hardware information stored in some other format).

Putting a Python module named kconfigfunctions(.py) anywhere in sys.path will
cause it to be imported by Kconfiglib (in Kconfig.__init__()). Note that
sys.path can be customized via PYTHONPATH, and includes the directory of the
module being run by default, as well as installation directories.

If the KCONFIG_FUNCTIONS environment variable is set, it gives a different
module name to use instead of 'kconfigfunctions'.

The imported module is expected to define a global dictionary named 'functions'
that maps function names to Python functions, as follows:

  def my_fn(kconf, name, arg_1, arg_2, ...):
      # kconf:
      #   Kconfig instance
      #
      # name:
      #   Name of the user-defined function ("my-fn"). Think argv[0].
      #
      # arg_1, arg_2, ...:
      #   Arguments passed to the function from Kconfig (strings)
      #
      # Returns a string to be substituted as the result of calling the
      # function
      ...

  def my_other_fn(kconf, name, arg_1, arg_2, ...):
      ...

  functions = {
      "my-fn":       (my_fn,       <min.args>, <max.args>/None),
      "my-other-fn": (my_other_fn, <min.args>, <max.args>/None),
      ...
  }

  ...

<min.args> and <max.args> are the minimum and maximum number of arguments
expected by the function (excluding the implicit 'name' argument). If
<max.args> is None, there is no upper limit to the number of arguments. Passing
an invalid number of arguments will generate a KconfigError exception.

Functions can access the current parsing location as kconf.filename/linenr.
Accessing other fields of the Kconfig object is not safe. See the warning
below.

Keep in mind that for a variable defined like 'foo = $(fn)', 'fn' will be
called only when 'foo' is expanded. If 'fn' uses the parsing location and the
intent is to use the location of the assignment, you want 'foo := $(fn)'
instead, which calls the function immediately.

Once defined, user functions can be called from Kconfig in the same way as
other preprocessor functions:

    config FOO
        ...
        depends on $(my-fn,arg1,arg2)

If my_fn() returns "n", this will result in

    config FOO
        ...
        depends on n

Warning
*******

User-defined preprocessor functions are called as they're encountered at parse
time, before all Kconfig files have been processed, and before the menu tree
has been finalized. There are no guarantees that accessing Kconfig symbols or
the menu tree via the 'kconf' parameter will work, and it could potentially
lead to a crash.

Preferably, user-defined functions should be stateless.

class Kconfig(object):
    """
    Represents a Kconfig configuration, e.g. for x86 or ARM. This is the set of
    symbols, choices, and menu nodes appearing in the configuration. Creating
    any number of Kconfig objects (including for different architectures) is
    safe. Kconfiglib doesn't keep any global state.

    The following attributes are available. They should be treated as
    read-only, and some are implemented through @property magic.

    syms:
      A dictionary with all symbols in the configuration, indexed by name. Also
      includes all symbols that are referenced in expressions but never
      defined, except for constant (quoted) symbols.

      Undefined symbols can be recognized by Symbol.nodes being empty -- see
      the 'Intro to the menu tree' section in the module docstring.

    const_syms:
      A dictionary like 'syms' for constant (quoted) symbols

    named_choices:
      A dictionary like 'syms' for named choices (choice FOO)

    defined_syms:
      A list with all defined symbols, in the same order as they appear in the
      Kconfig files. Symbols defined in multiple locations appear multiple
      times.

      Note: You probably want to use 'unique_defined_syms' instead. This
      attribute is mostly maintained for backwards compatibility.

    unique_defined_syms:
      A list like 'defined_syms', but with duplicates removed. Just the first
      instance is kept for symbols defined in multiple locations. Kconfig order
      is preserved otherwise.

      Using this attribute instead of 'defined_syms' can save work, and
      automatically gives reasonable behavior when writing configuration output
      (symbols defined in multiple locations only generate output once, while
      still preserving Kconfig order for readability).

    choices:
      A list with all choices, in the same order as they appear in the Kconfig
      files.

      Note: You probably want to use 'unique_choices' instead. This attribute
      is mostly maintained for backwards compatibility.

    unique_choices:
      Analogous to 'unique_defined_syms', for choices. Named choices can have
      multiple definition locations.

    menus:
      A list with all menus, in the same order as they appear in the Kconfig
      files

    comments:
      A list with all comments, in the same order as they appear in the Kconfig
      files

    kconfig_filenames:
      A list with the filenames of all Kconfig files included in the
      configuration, relative to $srctree (or relative to the current directory
      if $srctree isn't set), except absolute paths (e.g.
      'source "/foo/Kconfig"') are kept as-is.

      The files are listed in the order they are source'd, starting with the
      top-level Kconfig file. If a file is source'd multiple times, it will
      appear multiple times. Use set() to get unique filenames.

      Note that Kconfig.sync_deps() already indirectly catches any file
      modifications that change configuration output.

    env_vars:
      A set() with the names of all environment variables referenced in the
      Kconfig files.

      Only environment variables referenced with the preprocessor $(FOO) syntax
      will be registered. The older $FOO syntax is only supported for backwards
      compatibility.

      Also note that $(FOO) won't be registered unless the environment variable
      $FOO is actually set. If it isn't, $(FOO) is an expansion of an unset
      preprocessor variable (which gives the empty string).

      Another gotcha is that environment variables referenced in the values of
      recursively expanded preprocessor variables (those defined with =) will
      only be registered if the variable is actually used (expanded) somewhere.

      The note from the 'kconfig_filenames' documentation applies here too.

    n/m/y:
      The predefined constant symbols n/m/y. Also available in const_syms.

    modules:
      The Symbol instance for the modules symbol. Currently hardcoded to
      MODULES, which is backwards compatible. Kconfiglib will warn if
      'option modules' is set on some other symbol. Tell me if you need proper
      'option modules' support.

      'modules' is never None. If the MODULES symbol is not explicitly defined,
      its tri_value will be 0 (n), as expected.

      A simple way to enable modules is to do 'kconf.modules.set_value(2)'
      (provided the MODULES symbol is defined and visible). Modules are
      disabled by default in the kernel Kconfig files as of writing, though
      nearly all defconfig files enable them (with 'CONFIG_MODULES=y').

    defconfig_list:
      The Symbol instance for the 'option defconfig_list' symbol, or None if no
      defconfig_list symbol exists. The defconfig filename derived from this
      symbol can be found in Kconfig.defconfig_filename.

    defconfig_filename:
      The filename given by the defconfig_list symbol. This is taken from the
      first 'default' with a satisfied condition where the specified file
      exists (can be opened for reading). If a defconfig file foo/defconfig is
      not found and $srctree was set when the Kconfig was created,
      $srctree/foo/defconfig is looked up as well.

      'defconfig_filename' is None if either no defconfig_list symbol exists,
      or if the defconfig_list symbol has no 'default' with a satisfied
      condition that specifies a file that exists.

      Gotcha: scripts/kconfig/Makefile might pass --defconfig=<defconfig> to
      scripts/kconfig/conf when running e.g. 'make defconfig'. This option
      overrides the defconfig_list symbol, meaning defconfig_filename might not
      always match what 'make defconfig' would use.

    top_node:
      The menu node (see the MenuNode class) of the implicit top-level menu.
      Acts as the root of the menu tree.

    mainmenu_text:
      The prompt (title) of the top menu (top_node). Defaults to "Main menu".
      Can be changed with the 'mainmenu' statement (see kconfig-language.txt).

    variables:
      A dictionary with all preprocessor variables, indexed by name. See the
      Variable class.

    warn:
      Set this variable to True/False to enable/disable warnings. See
      Kconfig.__init__().

      When 'warn' is False, the values of the other warning-related variables
      are ignored.

      This variable as well as the other warn* variables can be read to check
      the current warning settings.

    warn_to_stderr:
      Set this variable to True/False to enable/disable warnings on stderr. See
      Kconfig.__init__().

    warn_assign_undef:
      Set this variable to True to generate warnings for assignments to
      undefined symbols in configuration files.

      This variable is False by default unless the KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF_ASSIGN
      environment variable was set to 'y' when the Kconfig instance was
      created.

    warn_assign_override:
      Set this variable to True to generate warnings for multiple assignments
      to the same symbol in configuration files, where the assignments set
      different values (e.g. CONFIG_FOO=m followed by CONFIG_FOO=y, where the
      last value would get used).

      This variable is True by default. Disabling it might be useful when
      merging configurations.

    warn_assign_redun:
      Like warn_assign_override, but for multiple assignments setting a symbol
      to the same value.

      This variable is True by default. Disabling it might be useful when
      merging configurations.

    warnings:
      A list of strings containing all warnings that have been generated, for
      cases where more flexibility is needed.

      See the 'warn_to_stderr' parameter to Kconfig.__init__() and the
      Kconfig.warn_to_stderr variable as well. Note that warnings still get
      added to Kconfig.warnings when 'warn_to_stderr' is True.

      Just as for warnings printed to stderr, only warnings that are enabled
      will get added to Kconfig.warnings. See the various Kconfig.warn*
      variables.

    missing_syms:
      A list with (name, value) tuples for all assignments to undefined symbols
      within the most recently loaded .config file(s). 'name' is the symbol
      name without the 'CONFIG_' prefix. 'value' is a string that gives the
      right-hand side of the assignment verbatim.

      See Kconfig.load_config() as well.

    srctree:
      The value the $srctree environment variable had when the Kconfig instance
      was created, or the empty string if $srctree wasn't set. This gives nice
      behavior with os.path.join(), which treats "" as the current directory,
      without adding "./".

      Kconfig files are looked up relative to $srctree (unless absolute paths
      are used), and .config files are looked up relative to $srctree if they
      are not found in the current directory. This is used to support
      out-of-tree builds. The C tools use this environment variable in the same
      way.

      Changing $srctree after creating the Kconfig instance has no effect. Only
      the value when the configuration is loaded matters. This avoids surprises
      if multiple configurations are loaded with different values for $srctree.

    config_prefix:
      The value the CONFIG_ environment variable had when the Kconfig instance
      was created, or "CONFIG_" if CONFIG_ wasn't set. This is the prefix used
      (and expected) on symbol names in .config files and C headers. Used in
      the same way in the C tools.

    config_header:
      The value the KCONFIG_CONFIG_HEADER environment variable had when the
      Kconfig instance was created, or the empty string if
      KCONFIG_CONFIG_HEADER wasn't set. This string is inserted verbatim at the
      beginning of configuration files. See write_config().

    header_header:
      The value the KCONFIG_AUTOHEADER_HEADER environment variable had when the
      Kconfig instance was created, or the empty string if
      KCONFIG_AUTOHEADER_HEADER wasn't set. This string is inserted verbatim at
      the beginning of header files. See write_autoconf().

    filename/linenr:
      The current parsing location, for use in Python preprocessor functions.
      See the module docstring.

        """
        Creates a new Kconfig object by parsing Kconfig files.
        Note that Kconfig files are not the same as .config files (which store
        configuration symbol values).

        See the module docstring for some environment variables that influence
        default warning settings (KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF and
        KCONFIG_WARN_UNDEF_ASSIGN).

        Raises KconfigError on syntax/semantic errors, and OSError or (possibly
        a subclass of) IOError on IO errors ('errno', 'strerror', and
        'filename' are available). Note that IOError is an alias for OSError on
        Python 3, so it's enough to catch OSError there. If you need Python 2/3
        compatibility, it's easiest to catch EnvironmentError, which is a
        common base class of OSError/IOError on Python 2 and an alias for
        OSError on Python 3.

        filename (default: "Kconfig"):
          The Kconfig file to load. For the Linux kernel, you'll want "Kconfig"
          from the top-level directory, as environment variables will make sure
          the right Kconfig is included from there (arch/$SRCARCH/Kconfig as of
          writing).

          If $srctree is set, 'filename' will be looked up relative to it.
          $srctree is also used to look up source'd files within Kconfig files.
          See the class documentation.

          If you are using Kconfiglib via 'make scriptconfig', the filename of
          the base base Kconfig file will be in sys.argv[1]. It's currently
          always "Kconfig" in practice.

        warn (default: True):
          True if warnings related to this configuration should be generated.
          This can be changed later by setting Kconfig.warn to True/False. It
          is provided as a constructor argument since warnings might be
          generated during parsing.

          See the other Kconfig.warn_* variables as well, which enable or
          suppress certain warnings when warnings are enabled.

          All generated warnings are added to the Kconfig.warnings list. See
          the class documentation.

        warn_to_stderr (default: True):
          True if warnings should be printed to stderr in addition to being
          added to Kconfig.warnings.

          This can be changed later by setting Kconfig.warn_to_stderr to
          True/False.

        encoding (default: "utf-8"):
          The encoding to use when reading and writing files, and when decoding
          output from commands run via $(shell). If None, the encoding
          specified in the current locale will be used.

          The "utf-8" default avoids exceptions on systems that are configured
          to use the C locale, which implies an ASCII encoding.

          This parameter has no effect on Python 2, due to implementation
          issues (regular strings turning into Unicode strings, which are
          distinct in Python 2). Python 2 doesn't decode regular strings
          anyway.

          Related PEP: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0538/

        suppress_traceback (default: False):
          Helper for tools. When True, any EnvironmentError or KconfigError
          generated during parsing is caught, the exception message is printed
          to stderr together with the command name, and sys.exit(1) is called
          (which generates SystemExit).

          This hides the Python traceback for "expected" errors like syntax
          errors in Kconfig files.

          Other exceptions besides EnvironmentError and KconfigError are still
          propagated when suppress_traceback is True.

        """
        Loads symbol values from a file in the .config format. Equivalent to
        calling Symbol.set_value() to set each of the values.

        "# CONFIG_FOO is not set" within a .config file sets the user value of
        FOO to n. The C tools work the same way.

        For each symbol, the Symbol.user_value attribute holds the value the
        symbol was assigned in the .config file (if any). The user value might
        differ from Symbol.str/tri_value if there are unsatisfied dependencies.

        Calling this function also updates the Kconfig.missing_syms attribute
        with a list of all assignments to undefined symbols within the
        configuration file. Kconfig.missing_syms is cleared if 'replace' is
        True, and appended to otherwise. See the documentation for
        Kconfig.missing_syms as well.

        See the Kconfig.__init__() docstring for raised exceptions
        (OSError/IOError). KconfigError is never raised here.

        filename (default: None):
          Path to load configuration from (a string). Respects $srctree if set
          (see the class documentation).

          If 'filename' is None (the default), the configuration file to load
          (if any) is calculated automatically, giving the behavior you'd
          usually want:

            1. If the KCONFIG_CONFIG environment variable is set, it gives the
               path to the configuration file to load. Otherwise, ".config" is
               used. See standard_config_filename().

            2. If the path from (1.) doesn't exist, the configuration file
               given by kconf.defconfig_filename is loaded instead, which is
               derived from the 'option defconfig_list' symbol.

            3. If (1.) and (2.) fail to find a configuration file to load, no
               configuration file is loaded, and symbols retain their current
               values (e.g., their default values). This is not an error.

           See the return value as well.

        replace (default: True):
          If True, all existing user values will be cleared before loading the
          .config. Pass False to merge configurations.

        verbose (default: None):
          Limited backwards compatibility to prevent crashes. A warning is
          printed if anything but None is passed.

          Prior to Kconfiglib 12.0.0, this option enabled printing of messages
          to stdout when 'filename' was None. A message is (always) returned
          now instead, which is more flexible.

          Will probably be removed in some future version.

        Returns a string with a message saying which file got loaded (or
        possibly that no file got loaded, when 'filename' is None). This is
        meant to reduce boilerplate in tools, which can do e.g.
        print(kconf.load_config()). The returned message distinguishes between
        loading (replace == True) and merging (replace == False).

        r"""
        Writes out symbol values in the .config format. The format matches the
        C implementation, including ordering.

        Symbols appear in the same order in generated .config files as they do
        in the Kconfig files. For symbols defined in multiple locations, a
        single assignment is written out corresponding to the first location
        where the symbol is defined.

        See the 'Intro to symbol values' section in the module docstring to
        understand which symbols get written out.

        If 'filename' exists and its contents is identical to what would get
        written out, it is left untouched. This avoids updating file metadata
        like the modification time and possibly triggering redundant work in
        build tools.

        See the Kconfig.__init__() docstring for raised exceptions
        (OSError/IOError). KconfigError is never raised here.

        filename (default: None):
          Path to write configuration to (a string).

          If None (the default), the path in the environment variable
          KCONFIG_CONFIG is used if set, and ".config" otherwise. See
          standard_config_filename().

        header (default: None):
          Text inserted verbatim at the beginning of the file. You would
          usually want each line to start with '#' to make it a comment, and
          include a trailing newline.

          if None (the default), the value of the environment variable
          KCONFIG_CONFIG_HEADER had when the Kconfig instance was created will
          be used if it was set, and no header otherwise. See the
          Kconfig.config_header attribute.

        save_old (default: True):
          If True and <filename> already exists, a copy of it will be saved to
          <filename>.old in the same directory before the new configuration is
          written.

          Errors are silently ignored if <filename>.old cannot be written (e.g.
          due to being a directory, or <filename> being something like
          /dev/null).

        verbose (default: None):
          Limited backwards compatibility to prevent crashes. A warning is
          printed if anything but None is passed.

          Prior to Kconfiglib 12.0.0, this option enabled printing of messages
          to stdout when 'filename' was None. A message is (always) returned
          now instead, which is more flexible.

          Will probably be removed in some future version.

        Returns a string with a message saying which file got saved. This is
        meant to reduce boilerplate in tools, which can do e.g.

        Creates or updates a directory structure that can be used to avoid
        doing a full rebuild whenever the configuration is changed, mirroring
        include/config/ in the kernel.

        This function is intended to be called during each build, before
        compiling source files that depend on configuration symbols.

        See the Kconfig.__init__() docstring for raised exceptions
        (OSError/IOError). KconfigError is never raised here.

        path:
          Path to directory

        sync_deps(path) does the following:

          1. If the directory <path> does not exist, it is created.

          2. If <path>/auto.conf exists, old symbol values are loaded from it,
             which are then compared against the current symbol values. If a
             symbol has changed value (would generate different output in
             autoconf.h compared to before), the change is signaled by
             touch'ing a file corresponding to the symbol.

             The first time sync_deps() is run on a directory, <path>/auto.conf
             won't exist, and no old symbol values will be available. This
             logically has the same effect as updating the entire
             configuration.

             The path to a symbol's file is calculated from the symbol's name
             by replacing all '_' with '/' and appending '.h'. For example, the
             symbol FOO_BAR_BAZ gets the file <path>/foo/bar/baz.h, and FOO
             gets the file <path>/foo.h.

             This scheme matches the C tools. The point is to avoid having a
             single directory with a huge number of files, which the underlying
             filesystem might not handle well.

          3. A new auto.conf with the current symbol values is written, to keep
             track of them for the next build.

             If auto.conf exists and its contents is identical to what would
             get written out, it is left untouched. This avoids updating file
             metadata like the modification time and possibly triggering
             redundant work in build tools.


        The last piece of the puzzle is knowing what symbols each source file
        depends on. Knowing that, dependencies can be added from source files
        to the files corresponding to the symbols they depends on. The source
        file will then get recompiled (only) when the symbol value changes
        (provided sync_deps() is run first during each build).

        The tool in the kernel that extracts symbol dependencies from source
        files is scripts/basic/fixdep.c. Missing symbol files also correspond
        to "not changed", which fixdep deals with by using the $(wildcard) Make
        function when adding symbol prerequisites to source files.

        In case you need a different scheme for your project, the sync_deps()
        implementation can be used as a template.

      The type of the symbol. One of BOOL, TRISTATE, STRING, INT, HEX, UNKNOWN.
      UNKNOWN is for undefined symbols, (non-special) constant symbols, and
      symbols defined without a type.

      When running without modules (MODULES having the value n), TRISTATE
      symbols magically change type to BOOL. This also happens for symbols
      within choices in "y" mode. This matches the C tools, and makes sense for
      menuconfig-like functionality.

    orig_type:
      The type as given in the Kconfig file, without any magic applied. Used
      when printing the symbol.

    tri_value:
      The tristate value of the symbol as an integer. One of 0, 1, 2,
      representing n, m, y. Always 0 (n) for non-bool/tristate symbols.

      This is the symbol value that's used outside of relation expressions
      (A, !A, A && B, A || B).

    str_value:
      The value of the symbol as a string. Gives the value for string/int/hex
      symbols. For bool/tristate symbols, gives "n", "m", or "y".

      This is the symbol value that's used in relational expressions
      (A = B, A != B, etc.)

      Gotcha: For int/hex symbols, the exact format of the value is often
      preserved (e.g. when writing a .config file), hence why you can't get it
      directly as an int. Do int(int_sym.str_value) or
      int(hex_sym.str_value, 16) to get the integer value.

    user_value:
      The user value of the symbol. None if no user value has been assigned
      (via Kconfig.load_config() or Symbol.set_value()).

      Holds 0, 1, or 2 for bool/tristate symbols, and a string for the other
      symbol types.

      WARNING: Do not assign directly to this. It will break things. Use
      Symbol.set_value().

    assignable:
      A tuple containing the tristate user values that can currently be
      assigned to the symbol (that would be respected), ordered from lowest (0,
      representing n) to highest (2, representing y). This corresponds to the
      selections available in the menuconfig interface. The set of assignable
      values is calculated from the symbol's visibility and selects/implies.

      Returns the empty set for non-bool/tristate symbols and for symbols with
      visibility n. The other possible values are (0, 2), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2),
      (1,), and (2,). A (1,) or (2,) result means the symbol is visible but
      "locked" to m or y through a select, perhaps in combination with the
      visibility. menuconfig represents this as -M- and -*-, respectively.

      For string/hex/int symbols, check if Symbol.visibility is non-0 (non-n)
      instead to determine if the value can be changed.

      Some handy 'assignable' idioms:

        # Is 'sym' an assignable (visible) bool/tristate symbol?
        if sym.assignable:
            # What's the highest value it can be assigned? [-1] in Python
            # gives the last element.
            sym_high = sym.assignable[-1]

            # The lowest?
            sym_low = sym.assignable[0]

            # Can the symbol be set to at least m?
            if sym.assignable[-1] >= 1:
                ...

        # Can the symbol be set to m?
        if 1 in sym.assignable:
            ...

    visibility:
      The visibility of the symbol. One of 0, 1, 2, representing n, m, y. See
      the module documentation for an overview of symbol values and visibility.

    config_string:
      The .config assignment string that would get written out for the symbol
      by Kconfig.write_config(). Returns the empty string if no .config
      assignment would get written out.

      In general, visible symbols, symbols with (active) defaults, and selected
      symbols get written out. This includes all non-n-valued bool/tristate
      symbols, and all visible string/int/hex symbols.

      Symbols with the (no longer needed) 'option env=...' option generate no
      configuration output, and neither does the special
      'option defconfig_list' symbol.

      Tip: This field is useful when generating custom configuration output,
      even for non-.config-like formats. To write just the symbols that would
      get written out to .config files, do this:

        if sym.config_string:
            *Write symbol, e.g. by looking sym.str_value*

      This is a superset of the symbols written out by write_autoconf().
      That function skips all n-valued symbols.

      There usually won't be any great harm in just writing all symbols either,
      though you might get some special symbols and possibly some "redundant"
      n-valued symbol entries in there.

    name_and_loc:
      Holds a string like

        "MY_SYMBOL (defined at foo/Kconfig:12, bar/Kconfig:14)"

      , giving the name of the symbol and its definition location(s).

      If the symbol is undefined, the location is given as "(undefined)".

    nodes:
      A list of MenuNodes for this symbol. Will contain a single MenuNode for
      most symbols. Undefined and constant symbols have an empty nodes list.
      Symbols defined in multiple locations get one node for each location.

    choice:
      Holds the parent Choice for choice symbols, and None for non-choice
      symbols. Doubles as a flag for whether a symbol is a choice symbol.

    defaults:
      List of (default, cond) tuples for the symbol's 'default' properties. For
      example, 'default A && B if C || D' is represented as
      ((AND, A, B), (OR, C, D)). If no condition was given, 'cond' is
      self.kconfig.y.

      Note that 'depends on' and parent dependencies are propagated to
      'default' conditions.

    selects:
      List of (symbol, cond) tuples for the symbol's 'select' properties. For
      example, 'select A if B && C' is represented as (A, (AND, B, C)). If no
      condition was given, 'cond' is self.kconfig.y.

      Note that 'depends on' and parent dependencies are propagated to 'select'
      conditions.

    implies:
      Like 'selects', for imply.

    ranges:
      List of (low, high, cond) tuples for the symbol's 'range' properties. For
      example, 'range 1 2 if A' is represented as (1, 2, A). If there is no
      condition, 'cond' is self.kconfig.y.

      Note that 'depends on' and parent dependencies are propagated to 'range'
      conditions.

      Gotcha: 1 and 2 above will be represented as (undefined) Symbols rather
      than plain integers. Undefined symbols get their name as their string
      value, so this works out. The C tools work the same way.

    orig_defaults:
    orig_selects:
    orig_implies:
    orig_ranges:
      See the corresponding attributes on the MenuNode class.

    rev_dep:
      Reverse dependency expression from other symbols selecting this symbol.
      Multiple selections get ORed together. A condition on a select is ANDed
      with the selecting symbol.

      For example, if A has 'select FOO' and B has 'select FOO if C', then
      FOO's rev_dep will be (OR, A, (AND, B, C)).

    weak_rev_dep:
      Like rev_dep, for imply.

    direct_dep:
      The direct ('depends on') dependencies for the symbol, or self.kconfig.y
      if there are no direct dependencies.

      This attribute includes any dependencies from surrounding menus and ifs.
      Those get propagated to the direct dependencies, and the resulting direct
      dependencies in turn get propagated to the conditions of all properties.

      If the symbol is defined in multiple locations, the dependencies from the
      different locations get ORed together.

    referenced:
      A set() with all symbols and choices referenced in the properties and
      property conditions of the symbol.

      Also includes dependencies from surrounding menus and ifs, because those
      get propagated to the symbol (see the 'Intro to symbol values' section in
      the module docstring).

      Choices appear in the dependencies of choice symbols.

      For the following definitions, only B and not C appears in A's
      'referenced'. To get transitive references, you'll have to recursively
      expand 'references' until no new items appear.

        config A
                bool
                depends on B

        config B
                bool
                depends on C

        config C
                bool

      See the Symbol.direct_dep attribute if you're only interested in the
      direct dependencies of the symbol (its 'depends on'). You can extract the
      symbols in it with the global expr_items() function.

    env_var:
      If the Symbol has an 'option env="FOO"' option, this contains the name
      ("FOO") of the environment variable. None for symbols without no
      'option env'.

      'option env="FOO"' acts like a 'default' property whose value is the
      value of $FOO.

      Symbols with 'option env' are never written out to .config files, even if
      they are visible. env_var corresponds to a flag called SYMBOL_AUTO in the
      C implementation.

    is_allnoconfig_y:
      True if the symbol has 'option allnoconfig_y' set on it. This has no
      effect internally (except when printing symbols), but can be checked by
      scripts.

    is_constant:
      True if the symbol is a constant (quoted) symbol.

    kconfig:
      The Kconfig instance this symbol is from.

        'assignable' will cause Symbol.user_value to differ from
        Symbol.str/tri_value (be truncated down or up).

        Setting a choice symbol to 2 (y) sets Choice.user_selection to the
        choice symbol in addition to setting Symbol.user_value.
        Choice.user_selection is considered when the choice is in y mode (the

          The user value to give to the symbol. For bool and tristate symbols,
          n/m/y can be specified either as 0/1/2 (the usual format for tristate
          values in Kconfiglib) or as one of the strings "n", "m", or "y". For
          other symbol types, pass a string.

          Note that the value for an int/hex symbol is passed as a string, e.g.
          "123" or "0x0123". The format of this string is preserved in the
          output.

          Values that are invalid for the type (such as "foo" or 1 (m) for a
          BOOL or "0x123" for an INT) are ignored and won't be stored in
          Symbol.user_value. Kconfiglib will print a warning by default for
          invalid assignments, and set_value() will return False.

        Returns True if the value is valid for the type of the symbol, and
        False otherwise. This only looks at the form of the value. For BOOL and

class Choice(object):
    """
    Represents a choice statement:

      choice
          ...
      endchoice

    The following attributes are available on Choice instances. They should be
    treated as read-only, and some are implemented through @property magic (but
    are still efficient to access due to internal caching).

    Note: Prompts, help texts, and locations are stored in the Choice's
    MenuNode(s) rather than in the Choice itself. Check the MenuNode class and
    the Choice.nodes attribute. This organization matches the C tools.

    name:
      The name of the choice, e.g. "FOO" for 'choice FOO', or None if the
      Choice has no name.

    type:
      The type of the choice. One of BOOL, TRISTATE, UNKNOWN. UNKNOWN is for
      choices defined without a type where none of the contained symbols have a
      type either (otherwise the choice inherits the type of the first symbol
      defined with a type).

      When running without modules (CONFIG_MODULES=n), TRISTATE choices
      magically change type to BOOL. This matches the C tools, and makes sense
      for menuconfig-like functionality.

    orig_type:
      The type as given in the Kconfig file, without any magic applied. Used
      when printing the choice.

    tri_value:
      The tristate value (mode) of the choice. A choice can be in one of three
      modes:

        0 (n) - The choice is disabled and no symbols can be selected. For
                visible choices, this mode is only possible for choices with
                the 'optional' flag set (see kconfig-language.txt).

        1 (m) - Any number of choice symbols can be set to m, the rest will
                be n.

        2 (y) - One symbol will be y, the rest n.

      Only tristate choices can be in m mode. The visibility of the choice is
      an upper bound on the mode, and the mode in turn is an upper bound on the
      visibility of the choice symbols.

      To change the mode, use Choice.set_value().

      Implementation note:
        The C tools internally represent choices as a type of symbol, with
        special-casing in many code paths. This is why there is a lot of
        similarity to Symbol. The value (mode) of a choice is really just a
        normal symbol value, and an implicit reverse dependency forces its
        lower bound to m for visible non-optional choices (the reverse
        dependency is 'm && <visibility>').

        Symbols within choices get the choice propagated as a dependency to
        their properties. This turns the mode of the choice into an upper bound
        on e.g. the visibility of choice symbols, and explains the gotcha
        related to printing choice symbols mentioned in the module docstring.

        Kconfiglib uses a separate Choice class only because it makes the code
        and interface less confusing (especially in a user-facing interface).
        Corresponding attributes have the same name in the Symbol and Choice
        classes, for consistency and compatibility.

    str_value:
      Like choice.tri_value, but gives the value as one of the strings
      "n", "m", or "y"

    user_value:
      The value (mode) selected by the user through Choice.set_value(). Either
      0, 1, or 2, or None if the user hasn't selected a mode. See
      Symbol.user_value.

      WARNING: Do not assign directly to this. It will break things. Use
      Choice.set_value() instead.

    assignable:
      See the symbol class documentation. Gives the assignable values (modes).

    selection:
      The Symbol instance of the currently selected symbol. None if the Choice
      is not in y mode or has no selected symbol (due to unsatisfied
      dependencies on choice symbols).

      WARNING: Do not assign directly to this. It will break things. Call
      sym.set_value(2) on the choice symbol you want to select instead.

    user_selection:
      The symbol selected by the user (by setting it to y). Ignored if the
      choice is not in y mode, but still remembered so that the choice "snaps
      back" to the user selection if the mode is changed back to y. This might
      differ from 'selection' due to unsatisfied dependencies.

      WARNING: Do not assign directly to this. It will break things. Call
      sym.set_value(2) on the choice symbol to be selected instead.

    visibility:
      See the Symbol class documentation. Acts on the value (mode).

    name_and_loc:
      Holds a string like

        "<choice MY_CHOICE> (defined at foo/Kconfig:12)"

      , giving the name of the choice and its definition location(s). If the
      choice has no name (isn't defined with 'choice MY_CHOICE'), then it will
      be shown as "<choice>" before the list of locations (always a single one
      in that case).

    syms:
      List of symbols contained in the choice.

      Obscure gotcha: If a symbol depends on the previous symbol within a
      choice so that an implicit menu is created, it won't be a choice symbol,
      and won't be included in 'syms'.

    nodes:
      A list of MenuNodes for this choice. In practice, the list will probably
      always contain a single MenuNode, but it is possible to give a choice a
      name and define it in multiple locations.

    defaults:
      List of (symbol, cond) tuples for the choice's 'defaults' properties. For
      example, 'default A if B && C' is represented as (A, (AND, B, C)). If
      there is no condition, 'cond' is self.kconfig.y.

      Note that 'depends on' and parent dependencies are propagated to
      'default' conditions.

    orig_defaults:
      See the corresponding attribute on the MenuNode class.

    direct_dep:
      See Symbol.direct_dep.

    referenced:
      A set() with all symbols referenced in the properties and property
      conditions of the choice.

      Also includes dependencies from surrounding menus and ifs, because those
      get propagated to the choice (see the 'Intro to symbol values' section in
      the module docstring).

    is_optional:
      True if the choice has the 'optional' flag set on it and can be in
      n mode.

    kconfig:
      The Kconfig instance this choice is from.

    Represents a menu node in the configuration. This corresponds to an entry
    in e.g. the 'make menuconfig' interface, though non-visible choices, menus,
    and comments also get menu nodes. If a symbol or choice is defined in
    multiple locations, it gets one menu node for each location.

    The top-level menu node, corresponding to the implicit top-level menu, is
    available in Kconfig.top_node.

    The menu nodes for a Symbol or Choice can be found in the
    Symbol/Choice.nodes attribute. Menus and comments are represented as plain
    menu nodes, with their text stored in the prompt attribute (prompt[0]).
    This mirrors the C implementation.

    The following attributes are available on MenuNode instances. They should
    be viewed as read-only.

    item:
      Either a Symbol, a Choice, or one of the constants MENU and COMMENT.
      Menus and comments are represented as plain menu nodes. Ifs are collapsed
      (matching the C implementation) and do not appear in the final menu tree.

    next:
      The following menu node. None if there is no following node.

    list:
      The first child menu node. None if there are no children.

      Choices and menus naturally have children, but Symbols can also have
      children because of menus created automatically from dependencies (see
      kconfig-language.txt).

    parent:
      The parent menu node. None if there is no parent.

    prompt:
      A (string, cond) tuple with the prompt for the menu node and its
      conditional expression (which is self.kconfig.y if there is no
      condition). None if there is no prompt.

      For symbols and choices, the prompt is stored in the MenuNode rather than
      the Symbol or Choice instance. For menus and comments, the prompt holds
      the text.

    defaults:
      The 'default' properties for this particular menu node. See
      symbol.defaults.

      When evaluating defaults, you should use Symbol/Choice.defaults instead,
      as it include properties from all menu nodes (a symbol/choice can have
      multiple definition locations/menu nodes). MenuNode.defaults is meant for
      documentation generation.

    selects:
      Like MenuNode.defaults, for selects.

    implies:
      Like MenuNode.defaults, for implies.

    ranges:
      Like MenuNode.defaults, for ranges.

    orig_prompt:
    orig_defaults:
    orig_selects:
    orig_implies:
    orig_ranges:
      These work the like the corresponding attributes without orig_*, but omit
      any dependencies propagated from 'depends on' and surrounding 'if's (the
      direct dependencies, stored in MenuNode.dep).

      One use for this is generating less cluttered documentation, by only
      showing the direct dependencies in one place.

    help:
      The help text for the menu node for Symbols and Choices. None if there is
      no help text. Always stored in the node rather than the Symbol or Choice.
      It is possible to have a separate help text at each location if a symbol
      is defined in multiple locations.

      Trailing whitespace (including a final newline) is stripped from the help
      text. This was not the case before Kconfiglib 10.21.0, where the format
      was undocumented.

    dep:
      The direct ('depends on') dependencies for the menu node, or
      self.kconfig.y if there are no direct dependencies.

      This attribute includes any dependencies from surrounding menus and ifs.
      Those get propagated to the direct dependencies, and the resulting direct
      dependencies in turn get propagated to the conditions of all properties.

      If a symbol or choice is defined in multiple locations, only the
      properties defined at a particular location get the corresponding
      MenuNode.dep dependencies propagated to them.

    visibility:
      The 'visible if' dependencies for the menu node (which must represent a
      menu), or self.kconfig.y if there are no 'visible if' dependencies.
      'visible if' dependencies are recursively propagated to the prompts of
      symbols and choices within the menu.

    referenced:
      A set() with all symbols and choices referenced in the properties and
      property conditions of the menu node.

      Also includes dependencies inherited from surrounding menus and ifs.
      Choices appear in the dependencies of choice symbols.

    is_menuconfig:
      Set to True if the children of the menu node should be displayed in a
      separate menu. This is the case for the following items:

        - Menus (node.item == MENU)

        - Choices

        - Symbols defined with the 'menuconfig' keyword. The children come from
          implicitly created submenus, and should be displayed in a separate
          menu rather than being indented.

      'is_menuconfig' is just a hint on how to display the menu node. It's
      ignored internally by Kconfiglib, except when printing symbols.

    filename/linenr:
      The location where the menu node appears. The filename is relative to
      $srctree (or to the current directory if $srctree isn't set), except
      absolute paths are used for paths outside $srctree.

    include_path:
      A tuple of (filename, linenr) tuples, giving the locations of the
      'source' statements via which the Kconfig file containing this menu node
      was included. The first element is the location of the 'source' statement
      in the top-level Kconfig file passed to Kconfig.__init__(), etc.

      Note that the Kconfig file of the menu node itself isn't included. Check
      'filename' and 'linenr' for that.

    kconfig:
      The Kconfig instance the menu node is from.
